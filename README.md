 ## A Royal Decree: Get Thyself a Worthy Server! üëëüè∞

Hear ye, hear ye! By order of MC Kingdoms, we declare Bisect Hosting the official purveyor of realms in our digital dominion!

Why, you ask? 

1. They've been supporting our kingdom since we were but a humble village.
2. Their customer support is so good, it's practically sorcery.
3. We'd recommend them even if they didn't give us shiny gold coins (but they do, and it's awesome).

Use the sacred code **TBM25** to receive a royal 25% discount on your first month. 

Remember, a kingdom without a good server is like a knight without a horse - awkward and probably not going anywhere fast.

*Testimonial from the Royal Court:* "I'd trust Bisect with my crown jewels... if I had any." - Your Truly, MC Kingdoms Dev

So rally your troops and claim your server today!

*Disclaimer: Server stability may vary based on the number of creepers you anger.*
