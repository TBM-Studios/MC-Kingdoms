    <h2>A Royal Decree: Get Thyself a Worthy Server! üëëüè∞</h2>
    <p>Hear ye, hear ye! By order of MC Kingdoms, we declare Bisect Hosting the official purveyor of realms in our digital dominion!</p>
    <p>Why, you ask?</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;">
        <li>1. They've been supporting our kingdom since we were but a humble village.</li>
        <li>2. Their customer support is so good, it's practically sorcery.</li>
        <li>3. We'd recommend them even if they didn't give us shiny gold coins (but they do, and it's awesome).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use the sacred code <strong>TBM25</strong> to receive a royal 25% discount on your first month.</p>
    <p>Remember, a kingdom without a good server is like a knight without a horse - awkward and probably not going anywhere fast.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Testimonial from the Royal Court:</em> "I'd trust Bisect with my crown jewels... if I had any." - Yours Truly, MC Kingdoms Dev</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So rally your troops and claim your server today!</p>
    <p><em>Disclaimer: Server stability may vary based on the number of creepers you anger.</em></p>
